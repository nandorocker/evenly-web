We at Evenly are looking for an office manager to substitute our current office manager during her maternity leave for 20h/week in Berlin.

## What we have to offer:

- Be part of our small owner-run consultancy where we build high quality apps
- Nice work environment and a diverse team
- Office in the heart of Berlin-Kreuzberg
- Flexible, family friendly working hours
- Learn about mobile Apps, iOS and Android

## What we want from you:

- Reading and writing in German (fluent) and English
- Experience with clerical work and administering payroll and office expenses
- Some experience with event management would be helpful (nothing too extensive, we sometimes organize hack days and things like that)
- Organizational skills, team spirit and good communication skills
- Ideally, you should be available to start on January 2nd 2017, so you have some transition time with our current office manager

The position is temporary and limited to 8-10 months (exact time to be determined).

**Note:** This is an on-site, part-time position.
