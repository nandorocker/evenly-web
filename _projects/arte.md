   We are building the app for the German-French TV channel ARTE. Together with [Novoda](https://www.novoda.com) and [Studio GOOD](http://www.studio-good.de) we reimagined their iPhone, iPad and Android Apps. The apps features a live stream as well as a media center that allows the user to enjoy previous movies, series, news and shows. The user can choose between a German and a French version with or without subtitles. There are also subtitles for the hearing-impaired.
   Users can also mark shows as favorites and get push-notifications if they don't want to miss the show.
