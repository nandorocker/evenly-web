    The Digital Concert Hall by the Berlin Philharmonics is the worlds biggest collection of videos of classical concerts. The archive has an ever growing list of about 280 high quality recordings of concerts from the Karajan years until today which is exclusively available only there. Additionally the app features a selection of documentary movies, free educational content and free video interviews with the artists. On top of that, all concerts by the Berlin Philharmonics are streamed live in best HD quality to a worldwide audience.

    Version 2.0 of the app is a complete rewrite and features a new design as well as new ways to consume the video content: Besides being heavily optimized for Airplay and offline use, the app will continue playback even in the background while using other apps.
